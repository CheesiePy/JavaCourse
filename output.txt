I've paid my dues time after time
I've done my sentence but committed no crime
And bad mistakes, I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

And we mean to go on, and on, and on, and on
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world
I've taken my bows and my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune
And everything that goes with it, I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses, no pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before
The whole human race and I ain't gonna lose
And we mean to go on, and on, and on and on
And we'll keep on fighting till the end, oh
No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions
